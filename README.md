# Hi there, I'm Apurva Singh 👋

**Low-Latency Alchemist | Ancient Java Warrior | Occasional Writer**

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Up To
- Leading the charge on ultra-low-latency trading systems at a major US Bank's eTrading team
- Pioneering our migration from Java/ION to Rust/Aeron/SBE to achieve **single-microsecond tick-to-trade latency**
- On a mission to prove that Rust can help us earn lots of $$$ which Java can't in market making trading

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
**Languages:** Rust (new love), Java (25+ years), Python  
**Tech Stack:** Aeron, SBE, Low-Latency Systems, High-Performance Computing  
**Specialties:** JVM Performance Tuning, Lock-Free Algorithms, System Architecture  

## ✍️ Thought Leadership
I occasionally write about technical deep dives and exotic subjects:
- [My Medium Articles](https://medium.com/me/stories/public)  
*(Topics on obscure programming paradigms and some trading too)*

## 🏆 StackOverflow Contributions
- Top 10% contributor with 5000+ reputation
- [My SO Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486720/apurva-singh)  
*(Though I'll admit I've gotten a bit lazy recently - those Rust borrow checker questions are calling my name!)*

## 🤔 Philosophy
"First make it work, then make it fast - unless you're building low latency trading systems, then you only get one shot at both."

## 📫 How to Reach Me
Let's connect if you're into:
- Pushing performance boundaries
- War stories from the JVM trenches
- Rust's fight against Java in low-latency systems
- Or just want to debate monads vs. traits

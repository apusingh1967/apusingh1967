- At eTrading team in a major US Bank; our manadate is to acheive single microsecond latency in tick to trade! And we are moving all our Java + ION shop to Rust + Aeron/SBE
- Otherwise and ancient Java warrior, more than 25 years
- A keen wannabe writer, I have some articles on exotic subjects at: https://medium.com/me/stories/public
- Consistent stackoverflow contributor (breached 5000), among top 10% usually but got bit lazy of late: https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486720/apurva-singh# Hi there, I'm Apurva Singh üëã

**Low-Latency Alchemist | Ancient Java Warrior | Occasional Writer**

## üî≠ What I'm Currently Up To
- Leading the charge on ultra-low-latency trading systems at a major US Bank's eTrading team
- Pioneering our migration from Java/ION to Rust/Aeron/SBE to achieve **single-microsecond tick-to-trade latency**
- On a mission to prove that Rust can outperform Java in high-frequency trading

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Arsenal
**Languages:** Rust (new love), Java (25+ years), Python  
**Tech Stack:** Aeron, SBE, Low-Latency Systems, High-Performance Computing  
**Specialties:** JVM Performance Tuning, Lock-Free Algorithms, System Architecture  

## ‚úçÔ∏è Thought Leadership
I occasionally write about technical deep dives and exotic subjects:
- [My Medium Articles](https://medium.com/me/stories/public)  
*(Topics range from high-frequency trading to obscure programming paradigms)*

## üèÜ StackOverflow Contributions
- Top 10% contributor with 5000+ reputation
- [My SO Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486720/apurva-singh)  
*(Though I'll admit I've gotten a bit lazy recently - those Rust borrow checker questions are calling my name!)*

## ü§î Philosophy
"First make it work, then make it fast - unless you're building HFT systems, then you only get one shot at both."

## üì´ How to Reach Me
Let's connect if you're into:
- Pushing performance boundaries
- War stories from the JVM trenches
- Rust's fight against Java in low-latency systems
- Or just want to debate monads vs. traits
